It's all in the box! Run all your ETL or ELT jobs with this .NET class library. Create your own dataflow, send your data from any source to any target and transform it on-the-fly. Data can be read from or written into various sources, e.g. Flat Files, Webservices or Databases. ETLBox currently supports: SqlServer, SQLite, MySql, Postgres, CSV, Json, Excel (and limited support for Access and SSAS). Furthermore, ETLBox offers control flow tasks that wrap Sql in easy-to-use objects and offers an enhanced logging functionality.

## Why ETLBox

ETLBox is a comprehensive C# class library that is able to manage your whole ETL or ELT.  You can use it to create your own dataflow pipeline programmatically, where data is send from a source to a target and transformed on its way. Or you just can use it to manage your database using some easy-to-use and easy-to-understand .NET objects. It also offers extended logging capabilites that allow you to monitor and anlayze your ETL job runs.

Perhaps you are looking for an alternative to Sql Server Integrations Services (SSIS). Or you are searching for a framework to define and run ETL jobs with C# code. The goal of ETLBox is to provide an easy-to-use but still powerful library with which you can create complex ETL routines and sophisticated data flows.

### Advantages of using ETLBox

**Build ETL in .NET**: Code your ETL with your favorite .NET language fitting your teamâ€™s skills and that is coming with a mature toolset.

**Runs everywhere**: ETLBox runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is written in the current .NET Standard and successfully tested with the latest versions of .NET Core & .NET.

**Run locally**: Develop and test your ETL code locally on your desktop using your existing development & debugging tools.

**Process In-Memory**: ETLBox comes with dataflow components that allow in-memory processing which is much faster than storing data on disk and processing later.

**Know your errors**: When exceptions are raised you get the exact line of code where your ETL stopped, including a hands-on description of the error.

**Manage Change**: Track you changes with git (or other source controls), code review your etl logic, and use your existing CI/CD processes.

**Data integration**: While supporting different databases, flat files and web services, you can use ETLBox as a foundation for your custom made Data Integregation platform. 

### Out-of-the-box supported sources and destinations

The following table shows which types of sources and destination are supported out-of-the box with the current version of ETLBox.

**Please note: You can *always* inegrate any other database, file or source not listed here by using a `CustomSource` or `CustomDestination`.**

## ETLBox capabilities

ETLBox is split into two main components: Data Flow and Control Flow Tasks. Both components will provide customizable logging functionalities.

### Data Flow overview

Dataflow tasks gives you the ability to create your own pipeline where you can send your data through. Dataflows consists of one or more source element (like CSV files or data derived from a table), some transformations and optionally one or more target. To create your own data flow , you need to accomplish three steps:

- First you define your dataflow components
- You link these components together (each source has an output, each transformation at least one input and one output and each destination has an input)
- After the linking you just tell your source to start reading the data.

The source will start reading and post its data into the components connected to its output. As soon as a connected component retrieves any data in its input, the component will start with processing the data and then send it further down the line to its connected components. The dataflow will finish when all data from the source(s) are read and received from the destinations.

Of course, all data is processed asynchronously by the components. Each compoment has its own set of buffers, so while the source is still reading data, the transformations  can already process it and the destinations can start writing the processed information into their target.

There are a lot of pre-defined components in ETLBox available. The `DBSource` can connect to a SqlServer, SQLite, MySql or Postgres table. There are transformation to modify either each record one-by-one or in whole. You can split or join different sources, and using the `CustomSource` and `CustomDestination` you can even connect to any target or source you want.

#### Data Flow quick example

It's easy to create your own data flow pipeline. This example data flow will transfer data from a MySql database into a Sql Server database and transform the records on the fly.

Just create a source, some transformation and a destination:

```C#
var sourceCon = new MySqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
var destCon = new SqlConnectionManager("Data Source=.;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=ETLBox;");

DBSource<MySimpleRow> source = new DBSource<MySimpleRow>(sourceCon, "SourceTable");
RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow> trans = new RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow>(
    myRow => {  
        myRow.Value += 1;
        return myRow;
    });
DBDestination<MySimpleRow> dest = new DBDestination<MySimpleRow>(destCon, "DestinationTable");
```

Now link these elements together.

```C#
source.LinkTo(trans);
trans.LinkTo(dest);
```

Finally, start the dataflow at the source and wait for your destination to rececive all data (and the completion message from the source).

```C#
source.Execute();
dest.Wait();
```

### Control Flow - overview

Control Flow Tasks gives you control over your database: They allow you to create or delete databases, tables, procedures, schemas or other objects in your database. With these tasks you also can truncate your tables, count rows or execute *any* sql you like. Anything you can script in sql can be done here - but with only one line of easy-to-read C# code. This improves the readability of your code a lot, and gives you more time to focus on your business logic. But Control Flow tasks are not restricted to databases only: e.g. you can run an XMLA on your Sql Server Analysis Service.

#### Control Flow quick example

It is now very easy to execute some Sql on the Database, without writing the whole "boilerplate" code by ADO.NET.

```C#
var conn = new SqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
//Execute some Sql
SqlTask.ExecuteNonQuery(conn, "Do some sql",$@"EXEC myProc");
//Count rows
int count = RowCountTask.Count(conn, "demo.table1").Value;
//Create a table
CreateTableTask.Create(conn, "Table1", new List<TableColumn>() {
    new TableColumn(name:"key",dataType:"INT",allowNulls:false,isPrimaryKey:true, isIdentity:true),
    new TableColumn(name:"value", dataType:"NVARCHAR(100)",allowNulls:true)
});
```

### Logging

By default, ETLBox uses and extends [NLog](https://nlog-project.org). ETLBox already comes with NLog as dependency - so you don't need to include additional packages from nuget. In order to have the logging activating, you just have to set up a nlog configuration called `nlog.config`, and create a target and a logger rule. After adding this, you will already get logging output for all tasks and components in ETLBox. [Read more about logging here](https://etlbox.net/articles/overview_logging.html).

## Getting ETLBox

You can use ETLBox within any .NET or .NET core project that supports .NET Standard 2.0. (Basically all latest versions of .NET)

### Variant 1: Nuget

[ETLBox is available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox). Just add the package to your project via your nuget package manager.

### Variant 2: Download the sources

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roadrunnerlenny/etlbox.git
```

Then, open the downloaded solution file ETLBox.sln with Visual Studio 2015 or higher.
Now you can build the solution, and use it as a reference in other projects.

## Going further

ETLBox is open source.Feel free to make changes or to fix bugs. Every particiation in this open source project is appreciated.
