## Version 1.0.0 (Released)

Initial release working on .NET Core.

## Version 1.0.1 (Released)

Reorganization of namespaces.

## Version 1.1.0 (Released)

* `DropDatabaseTask`: static "convenience" method name changed from delete to drop 
* `ConnectionManager` (general) improved:verified that the underlying ADO.NET connection pooling is working (see Issue#1)
* `OdbcConnectionManager`: ETLBox now supports connection via Odbc. (64bit only)
* `AccessOdbcConnectionManager`: ETLBox can now connect to access databases via ODBC (64bit ODBC driver required)
* `DBSource`: now accepts table name (instead of full table definition)
* `ExcelSource`: ETLBox can now read from excel files. 
* `CSVSource<CSVData>`: Adding a generic implementation for the CSVSource.
* `RowTransformation`: Adding a non generic implementation (same as `RowTansformation<string[],string[]`>)
* `DBDestination`: Adding a non generic implemnetation. (same as `DBDestination<string[]`>)

## Version 1.1.1 (Released)
* `DBDestination`: Fixed issue (#4) when destination table has more columns than input type.

## Version 1.1.2 (Released)
* `CSVSource`: Now you must use the `CsvHelper.Configuration.Configuration` class to modify the configuration settings. 
* `CSVSource`: POCOs now accept a CSVHelper classmap or CSVHelper attributes that support easy mapping of header names in CSV source files to C# properties (See issue #5)
The CsvHelper configuration and classmap feature is described on https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/
* `DBDestination`: In previous versions, the name of the properties were not matched with the column names of the destination table. 
    This is fixed now.

## Version 1.2 (Released)
* `ColumnMap`: Normally a mapping between property and column name is resolved using the property name. With the ColumnMap
attribute you can define the name of the column that should match with the property.
* `ExcelColumn`: The excel source now has it's own attribute to identify which property has which column index in the excel file. (Starting with 0)
* `DBSource`: Adding non generic implementation, fixing a bug that a Table Name without schema would throw an error.
* `Multicast`: Adding non generic implementation

## Version 1.2.1 (Released)
* `CSVSource`: Adding `SkipRows` Property to skip the first X rows in a source file before start reading.

## Version 1.2.2 (Released)
* Fixed bug with ConnectionManager in `DBSource`. Using a `DBSource` as non-generic class now works flawless.

## Version 1.2.3 (Released)
* Improved logging for Dataflow tasks.
