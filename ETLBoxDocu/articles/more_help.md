## Open Source

ETLBox was designed by me as an open source project and licensed under the MIT license. Therefore, it is completely
free of charge to use in any of your projects, doesn't matter if they are personal or commercial. In fact,
I think the personal use of an ETL framework is very limited, and I hope this tool can help you in your day-to-day business
problems.

## Getting more help

I started to create this toolbox about 2 years ago and I'm still happy to improve and maintain it. 
Though I did put a lot of effort in it, I still think of it as my favourite project and enjoy to add new code
and functionalities to it

I am a software developer with focus on C# and Sql, working more than 10 years in BI and ETL environments.
If you like this toolbox, and are looking for some freelancer that give you either training or other support with this
piece of software, I would be happy to help you. Feel free to contact me.

## Clean coding

At first glance, it can look like that some of the taks are not really adding big value to your project. But in accordance to clean coding, 
having written everything in a format which is easy-to-read and easy-to-understand, you are able to produce code that is easier to maintain. Having your code "clean" 
allows you to focus on the important parts of your logic and not be distracted by code lines that your brain need to "unravel" every time you go over them.
If you are interested in clean coding, you should read the "bible" on that topic, written by 
[Robert C. Martin: Clean Code](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=andreaslennar-21&linkId=CAKVL4PO6YCRW53L)
